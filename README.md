# Chronos Watchs

## Description: 
Chronos Watches, a platform for watch enthusiasts to share their collections and read articles about watches. The site was built using Django, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Cloudinary, and PostgreSQL. My role in this project was to design and implement the full-stack solution, including the integration of a blog section, providing a user-friendly and visually appealing platform for users to showcase their watches, read articles, and connect with like-minded individuals.
